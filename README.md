## Challenges that I face during this project

During the planning phase, I was ambitious and wanted many features to be included in the site. It got daunting until I broke down the objectives into smaller goals, and to focus on getting the MVP up first. There were some tech that I tried learning but unfortunately did not use as it is taking too much time from doing actual project such as Redux and Figma. Took me awhile to look for the right API but eventually decided on a few which I had fun playing around with. 

This project has a deadline of 3 weeks and I had to manage my time to fulfil other life commitments. I was away for 1 week plus to New York with my wife for both work and leisure, and coincidentally I had the chance to walk pass Wall Street and took a few touristy pictures with the famous charging bull. 

## Things that I will do more if I had more time

1. Try out financial news live API to be deployed so as to value add the website

2. Create a form that allows user to input, edit number of shares holdings so that personal portfolio can be tracked. 

3. Explore using Figma for planning, Redux and Next.js for execution.
